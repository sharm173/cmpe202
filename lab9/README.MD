<h1>LAB9 Design pattern implementation summary</h1>

I have implemented the stratergy design pattern first in OOP format and then in java Lambda functional</br>
programming style. The program takes a list of integers and outputs the total of all numbers, only even numbers</br>
and only odd numbers. In my opinion, the lambda code is much more clean and redable.
